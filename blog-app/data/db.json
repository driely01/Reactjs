U.S. payouts related to blogging totalled $17.4 million by 2009; in some cases these have been covered by umbrella insurance.[55] The courts have returned with mixed verdicts. Internet Service Providers (ISPs), in general, are immune from liability for information that originates with third parties (U.S. Communications Decency Act and the EU Directive 2000/31/EC). In Doe v. Cahill, the Delaware Supreme Court held that stringent standards had to be met to unmask the anonymous bloggers and also took the unusual step of dismissing the libel case itself (as unfounded under American libel law) rather than referring it back to the trial court for reconsideration.[56] In a bizarre twist, the Cahills were able to obtain the identity of John Doe, who turned out to be the person they suspected: the town's mayor, Councilman Cahill's political rival. The Cahills amended their original complaint, and the mayor settled the case rather than going to trial.\n\nIn January 2007, two prominent Malaysian political bloggers, Jeff Ooi and Ahirudin Attan, were sued by a pro-government newspaper, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad, Kalimullah bin Masheerul Hassan, Hishamuddin bin Aun and Brenden John a/l John Pereira over alleged defamation. The plaintiff was supported by the Malaysian government.[57] Following the suit, the Malaysian government proposed to \"register\" all bloggers in Malaysia to better control parties against their interests.[58] This is the first such legal case against bloggers in the country. In the United States, blogger Aaron Wall was sued by Traffic Power for defamation and publication of trade secrets in 2005.[59] According to Wired magazine, Traffic Power had been \"banned from Google for allegedly rigging search engine results.\"[60] Wall and other \"white hat\" search engine optimization consultants had exposed Traffic Power in what they claim was an effort to protect the public. The case was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction, and Traffic Power failed to appeal within the allowed time.",

      "body": "Nuts and grains are high in protein and nutrients, though their fat content (75 to 95 percent of total calories) means you shouldn't eat too many at a time. Macadamia, the gourmet of nuts, is the highest in fat. Walnuts and Brazil nuts are your best bet because they're rich in omega-3 fatty acids.\n\nOf all the nuts, peanuts provide the most complete protein. Other nuts are missing the amino acid lysine. But all are easily complemented by grains. As an alternative protein source, they also provide a good dose of healthy fats, including oleic acid, the healthy fat found in olive oil. Peanuts are rich in antioxidant polyphenols like those found in berries. Studies indicate that roasting actually increases the amount of polyphenol called p-coumaric, making roasted peanuts a true protector of cells.\n\nResearch has heartened nut lovers. Studies at Loma Linda University in California found that eating nuts five times a week (about two ounces a day) lowered participants' blood cholesterol levels by 12 percent. Walnuts were used, but similar results have been reported with almonds and peanuts. It appears that replacing saturated fat in the diet with the monounsaturated fat in nuts may be the key. It makes sense, then, to eat nuts instead of other fatty foods, not just to gobble them down on top of your regular fare.\n\nSome nuts, notably walnuts and Brazil nuts, are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which may contribute further to the fight against heart disease and possibly even arthritis. These healthful nuts also may play a role in weight loss and help you manage your weight better. Also, seeds and some nuts contain significant amounts of vitamin E. As an antioxidant, vitamin E can help prevent the oxidation of LDL cholesterol, which can damage arteries. More heartening news: Seeds are a good source of folic acid. Researchers have found that folic acid helps prevent the buildup of homocysteine. High levels of this amino acid have been linked to heart disease, dementia, and broken bones in people with osteoporosis. Eat plenty of folate to keep your homocysteine levels in check.\n\nSeeds, peanuts, and peanut butter are super sources of niacin. Nuts are chock-full of hard-to-get minerals, such as copper, iron, and zinc. Seeds are among the better plant sources of iron and zinc. Iron helps your blood deliver oxygen to your muscles and brain, while zinc helps boost your immune system. And nuts do their part to keep bones strong by providing magnesium, manganese, and boron.\n\nOne caution: Toxicity problems do not usually occur from eating foods, only from taking too much of a vitamin or mineral in supplement form. However, Brazil nuts contain an astonishingly high amount of selenium: about 70 to 90 micrograms per nut. In 2000 the National Academy of Sciences set the tolerable upper limit (UL) for selenium at 400 micrograms per day for adults. So, go easy on Brazil nuts, eating maybe one or two per day since you get selenium from other food sources, too.",

      "body": "Oats fill the bill when it comes to reducing hunger and keeping you on your diet plan. The soluble fiber in oats fills you up by creating gels. The gels delay stomach emptying, so you feel full longer, which helps with weight loss.\n\nWhether horse feed or muffins come to mind when you think of oats, you're probably underestimating this truly healthful grain. A whole grain full of fiber, oats pack plenty of punch.\n\nHealth Benefits\n\nEating a bowl of oatmeal in the morning can easily help you increase your intake of whole grains and help you meet the Dietary Guidelines' recommendation to make half of the grains you eat whole grains. Whole grains are beneficial not just because of their fiber, but also because they contain a variety of minerals and phytonutrients. Some of the phytonutrients include lignans, which may help protect your heart; plant sterols and stanols, which help normalize blood cholesterol levels; and antioxidants such as phenolic and phytic acids.\n\nSince the mid 1960s, many studies have highlighted the effect of oats' soluble fiber (the same beta-glucans found in barley) on blood-cholesterol levels. On average, eating three grams of soluble (not total) fiber a day (the amount in two bowls of oatmeal or one cup of cooked oat bran) reduced cholesterol by six points in three months. Participants with the highest cholesterol levels saw the best response; those whose blood-cholesterol levels were over 220 mg/dL saw their levels drop by 8 to 23 percent. Those who ate the most oat bran benefited the most. Another study showed that in certain individuals, oat bran can be as effective as, and certainly much less expensive as, medication in curbing elevated blood-cholesterol levels.\n\nSimilarly exciting results have been seen in people with diabetes and those with high-normal blood-sugar levels. The soluble fiber in oats means slower digestion, spreading the rise in blood sugar over a longer time period. Some people with diabetes who followed a diet high in soluble fiber from sources like oats and beans have been able to reduce their medication. Oats have more to offer everyone. They are tops in protein and manganese, providing 50 percent of the recommended intake for this mineral. In addition, they offer an unusual amount of iron, thiamin, and magnesium.",

      "body": "You might not look forward to it, but you still pour that bowl of bran cereal every day to keep yourself regular. Little did you know your bowlful was fighting fat, too.\n\nFirst, let's define what we mean by bran. Bran is simply the outer layer of any kernel of grain, where most of the fiber and nutrients reside. Here, we're just focusing on wheat bran cereals. (Learn more information about the weight-loss benefits of oats and oat bran by following the link.)\n\nNow, back to fighting fat. Fiber, especially the insoluble kind, fills you up. It has an amazing capacity to absorb water and expand. This bulk fools your belly into thinking you've eaten a lot, so it can shut down your hunger signals.\n\nMoreover, bran fiber requires a bit of chewing. That gives your body time to realize you're full before you shove in more. You complete the fat-fighting breakfast scene if you pour skim milk over that bowl of bran, mix in fresh fruit, and have a glass of orange juice on the side.\n\nHealth Benefits\n\nNo other food packs such a wallop of insoluble fiber at one sitting. There's no underestimating the health boost from a daily bowl of bran cereal. Here's a chronicle.\n\nConstipation: Eat enough insoluble fiber, such as bran, and you're practically guaranteed to avoid constipation -- as long as you increase your fluid intake, too. By absorbing water, bran creates bulk, which stimulates the intestines to contract and move things along.\n\nColon cancer: By increasing stool speed, bran ensures that bowel contents don't stagnate, so that means carcinogens, or cancer-causing agents, can't hang around long enough to cause trouble. And if carcinogens are present, a bulkier stool dilutes them. Other digestive-tract conditions: A soft, swift-moving stool may prevent and ease the pain associated with many other digestive conditions, such as hemorrhoids.\n\nAll this should be enough to convince you to dig into your bowl of bran with vigor. It gets your system going in the morning while providing as much as half the suggested fiber goal of 20 to 35 grams a day.",

It's this same vital component that makes them perfect for healthy eating and keeping your hunger to a minimum.\n\nA prune is a dried plum, typically the European variety of plum. The fruit's name was officially changed from \"prunes\" to \"dried plums\" by the Food and Drug Administration in 2001.\n\nThough relatively high in calories for their size, prunes have a reputation as a dieter's friend. They add a powerful dose of fiber and some nutrients to your diet that are needed when you follow a lower-calorie meal plan.\n\nHealth Benefits\n\nPrunes are a sweet way to add fat-free laxative fiber to your diet. A single prune contains more than half a gram of fiber and more than one gram of sorbitol (a carbohydrate that our bodies do not absorb well). Large amounts of sorbitol can cause diarrhea. Prunes also contain the laxative, diphenylisatin. No wonder they prevent constipation. So snack away, just don't go overboard. Although according to the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, it takes only 1/2 cup of dried fruit to count as 1 cup of fruit, you may want to eat less than that at any one time.\n\nIn contrast, prunes' reputation for being rich in iron doesn't hold true. In reality, they're a decent, but not spectacular, source. Prunes, however, get overlooked as a source of vitamin A, even though they provide more than ten percent of recommended levels. Potassium is another unexpected benefit you get from eating prunes, which is beneficial for blood pressure and regulating your heartbeat.\n\nPrunes contain the same phenols that plums have, protecting the fats in our system from damage. They also have significant amounts of beta-carotene, whose antioxidant function helps prevent cataracts, cancer, and heart disease.\n\n",

      "body": "Health Benefits of Nuts\nBy: Betsy Hornick & Eric Yarnell\n\nThe nuts category encompasses some foods that aren't true nuts but have been given honorary status due to their similar nutritional qualities. These include the peanut (a type of legume), the Brazil nut, and the cashew (both technically seeds). In this article, we will review how adding nuts to your diet can help strengthen your body. Eating healthier can be part of an alternative treatment against illness.\n\nIf you've relegated nuts to special occasions only, then it's time to reconsider. While they may be high in fat, nuts contain mostly mono- and polyunsaturated fats -- fats with a heart-friendly reputation. In one study, people who ate nuts -- almonds, cashews, pistachios, walnuts, or peanuts -- five or more times a week were half as likely to have a heart attack or suffer from heart disease as people who rarely or never ate nuts.\n\nThis protective effect may be attributable to the healthy fat profile of nuts, or it may be the result of the vitamin E and fiber found in nuts, both of which can help stave off heart disease; perhaps it's these several attributes combined and even other as yet unidentified ones that played a role. Other studies have demonstrated that adults with a high blood cholesterol level can lower both their total and LDL cholesterol levels by substituting nuts for other snack foods.\n\nBesides being rich in protein, nuts offer a host of other nutrients, such as folate, phosphorus, magnesium, copper, zinc, and selenium. Another bonus -- nuts are so dense with nutrients that they quell hunger pangs with fewer calories compared with other snack foods that often provide calories with minimal nutrition.\n\nSelection and Storage\nMost fresh nuts are available only in the fall and winter. Shelled nuts can be purchased anytime. Look for a freshness date on the package or container. If you can, check to be sure there aren't a lot of shriveled or discolored nuts. Be wary if you buy your nuts in bulk; they should smell fresh, not rancid.\n\nA caution: Aflatoxin, a known carcinogen produced by a mold that grows naturally on peanuts, can be a problem. Discard peanuts that are discolored, shriveled, or moldy or that taste bad. And stick to commercial brands of peanut butter. A survey found that best-selling brands contained only trace amounts of aflatoxin, but supermarket brands had five times that much, and fresh-ground peanut butters -- like those sold in health-food stores -- averaged more than ten times as much as the best-selling brands.\n\nBecause of their high fat content, you must protect nuts from rancidity. Nuts in their shells can be kept for a few months in a cool, dry location. But once they've been shelled or their containers opened, the best way to preserve them is to refrigerate or freeze them.\n\nPreparation and Serving Tips\nTo munch on as a snack, nuts are pretty much a self-serve affair. For nuts that are tough to crack, use a nutcracker or even pliers. A nutpick is useful for walnuts. Brazil nuts open easier if you chill them first. Almonds can be peeled by boiling them, then dunking them in cold water.\n\nIn cooking and baking, it's easy to get the nutritional benefits of nuts without overdosing on fat and calories, because a small amount of nuts adds a lot of flavor. Nuts sprinkled on your cereal can boost your morning fiber intake. Peanut butter makes a great snack on apple wedges or celery or simply spread on a piece of hearty whole-wheat toast. Walnuts go well tossed in Waldorf salad or with orange sections and spinach. Almonds dress up almost any vegetable when sprinkled on top.\n\nNuts give grains extra pizzazz and crunch. Pignoli, or pine nuts, add a dash of Mediterranean flavor when included in pasta dishes; they're the nuts you'll find in your pesto dishes. Nuts stirred into yogurt make it a more satisfying light meal. And spice-cake and quick-bread mixes as well as pancake batters produce extra-special results when nuts are added in.\n\n©Publications International, Ltd.\n\nOats: Natural Weight-Loss Foods\nBy: the Editors of Publications International, Ltd.\n\nOats fill the bill when it comes to reducing hunger and keeping you on your diet plan.

They are tops in protein and manganese, providing 50 percent of the recommended intake for this mineral. In addition, they offer an unusual amount of iron, thiamin, and magnesium.\n\nSelection and Storage\nThe bran of the oat grain is the outer layer of the oat kernel, where much of the fiber and many of the nutrients reside. Whole oats (rolled or steel-cut) contain the bran along with the rest of the oat kernel. Oat bran contains the same nutrients and fiber found in whole oats but they are more concentrated. So eating whole oats will give you the same benefits of oat bran, you'll just need to eat more of it to get the same effect.\n\nCooking time and texture are the only differences among the varieties. Steel-cut oats, sometimes called Scotch oats or Irish oats, are whole oats sliced into thick, elongated pieces. They have a chewy texture and take about 20 minutes to cook.\n\nRolled oats are steamed and flattened between steel rollers, so they take about five minutes to cook and are easier to chew than steel-cut oats.\n\nQuick oats are cut into smaller pieces before being rolled, so they cook very quickly, in about a minute.\n\nInstant oats are precooked and pressed so thin it takes only boiling water to \"reconstitute\" them. Generally, they have a lot of added sodium; the flavored versions also have added sugar. Try the different varieties to see which flavor and texture you like better.\n\nStore oats in a dark, dry location in a well-sealed container. Oats will keep up to a year. Whole oats are more likely to go rancid, so be sure to refrigerate them.\n\nPreparation and Serving Tips\nTo make oatmeal, all you do is simmer rolled oats in water on the stove for five minutes (one minute for quick oats). You can also cook oats in the microwave. Start with 1/3 cup oats and 2/3 cup milk for a calcium boost. Microwave for 3 minutes. Do not overcook your oatmeal or it will be thick and gummy. If you like, sprinkle with cinnamon and top with fat-free milk. You couldn't find a more satisfying, low-fat, high-fiber way to start the day. Oat bran can be served as a hot cereal, too; it takes about six minutes to cook, or bake oat bran into a low-fat muffin recipe.\n\nGranola is traditionally made with oats. By making it yourself, you can avoid the fat trap that many commercial varieties fall into. First, toast the oats in a shallow pan in an oven preheated to 300 degrees Fahrenheit, stirring occasionally until brown. Then combine the oats with wheat germ, raisins, your favorite nuts or seeds (toasted), dried fruit if you like, and a little honey. Let the mixture cool, then store it in an air-tight container in the refrigerator.\n\nWhole oats (called groats) can be cooked (simmer with 3 parts water for 50 to 60 minutes) and combined with rice for a pilaf or mixed with vegetables and seeds for a main dish.\n\nBoth oat bran and oats (rolled or quick) can be used in baking. Oats alone don't contain enough gluten to make bread, but you can modify your recipes to include half the grain as oats. To make oat flour, pulverize rolled oats in a coffee grinder until they have the same consistency as flour.\n\nWhether you want to lose weight or simply do something good for your health, incorporating this food into your diet will bring big nutritious dividends.\n\n©Publications International, Ltd.\n\nNutritional Values Rolled Oats, Cooked (Oatmeal)\nServing Size: 3/4 cup (1/3 cup uncooked)\n\nCalories 110\n\nFat: 2 g\n\nSaturated Fat: <1 g\n\nCholesterol: 0 mg\n\nCarbohydrate: 19 g\n\nProtein: 5 g\n\nDietary Fiber: 3 g\n\nSodium: 1 mg\n\nThiamin: <1 mg\n\nIron: 1 mg\n\nMagnesium: 42 mg\n\nManganese: 1 mg\n\nPhosphorus: 133 mg\n\nZinc: 1 mg\n\nREAD MORE\nLentils: Natural Weight-Loss Food\nBy: the Editors of Publications International, Ltd.\n\nLentils are brimming with fiber, which is crucial to satisfying your hunger and reducing your appetite. This food is rich in soluble fiber, which also lowers blood cholesterol as it gives you that full feeling you need to avoid temptation and help with weight loss.\n\nNot only that, but because they boast a bevy of nutrients, lentils are finally gaining the recognition they deserve as a great source of low-fat protein, making them the perfect substitute for meat. They are in the legume category and can be considered a vegetable or a protein, but not both at the same meal. The 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggest eating about three cups of legumes each week to maintain a healthy diet.\n\nContents\nHealth Benefits\nSelection and Storage\nPreparation and Serving Tips\nHealth Benefits\nLentils' high fiber content is a boon to health; it's mostly the soluble kind, so it lowers blood cholesterol by creating gels that bind with bile acids, forcing the body to use cholesterol to replace them. These gels also tie up carbohydrates, so they are absorbed more slowly, stabilizing blood sugar levels and of benefit to anyone with a goal of eating fewer calories.\n\nLentils are exceptionally high in folic acid, which can help prevent certain birth defects and may prevent heart disease, dementia, and bone fractures in people with osteoporosis. Lentils are an important source of iron for vegetarians, serving as protection against anemia. They also are a good source of magnesium, which plays a role in relaxing the smooth muscles that line the inside of your arteries. This helps lower blood pressure and allows blood to flow more freely.\n\nSelection and Storage\nBrown, green, and red lentils are the most common varieties in the United States. Most supermarkets carry them packaged, but you can buy them in bulk at health-food stores and gourmet markets.\n\nIf you buy them packaged, look for well-sealed bags with uniformly sized, brightly colored, disk-shaped lentils. If you buy them in bulk, check the lentils for tiny pinholes. Don't buy them if you spot holes; they're a sign of insect infestation. When stored in a well-sealed container at a cool temperature, lentils keep for up to a year.\n\nPreparation and Serving Tips\nRed lentils cook quickly and become mushy, so they work best in dishes where a firm texture isn't a concern, like in soups, purees, or dips. Brown or green lentils, on the other hand, retain their shape if not overcooked and can be used in salads or any dish in which you don't want your lentils to be very soft. Most lentils cook in 30 to 45 minutes or less and they don't require any precooking soak like dried beans do. Best of all, lentils are willing recipients of flavorful herbs and spices, taking on the flavors of the foods they are mixed with. No wonder they are common in Indian, Middle Eastern, and African recipes.\n\nFor years, researchers have seen a link between people who eat less meat and those who are not only slimmer than frequent meat-eaters, but also have a lower rate of heart disease, heart attacks, and stroke. So lentils are a good health bet all around.\n\n©Publications International, Ltd.\n\nNutritional Values Lentils\nServing Size: 1/2 cup, cooked Calories: 115\n\nFat: 0 g\n\nSaturated Fat: <1 g\n\nCholesterol: 0 mg\n\nCarbohydrate: 20 g\n\nProtein: 9 g\n\nDietary Fiber: 8 g\n\nSodium: 2 mg\n\nFolic Acid: 179 mcg\n\nNiacin: 1 mg\n\nThiamin: <1 mg\n\nVitamin B6: <1 mg\n\nCalcium: 19 mg\n\nCopper: <1 mg\n\nIron: 3 mg\n\nMagnesium: 35 mg\n\nManganese: <1 mg\n\nPhosphorus: 178 mg\n\nPotassium: 366 mg\n\nZinc: 1\n\nREAD MORE\nMelons: Natural Weight-Loss Food\nBy: the Editors of Publications International, Ltd.\n\nThe juicy sweetness of melons gives you the satisfaction of dessert without the hit to your waistline. The natural sweetness found in watermelons and cantaloupes can help you turn away from those ingredients to avoid: white table sugar (known as sucrose), corn syrup, and honey, all of which provide calories and few nutrients.\n\nMelons may come in different shapes, sizes, and colors, but they all have two things in common: a soft, sweet, juicy pulp and superb taste. That's why it's hard to say no to melons. They offer a decent dose of fiber, which helps fill you up. As a snack for dieters, melons can't be beat. Their juicy sweetness is just the substitute for high-calorie snacks and desserts. The 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that most people eat 1.5 to 2 cups of fruit per day. Melons are a great-tasting way to fulfill that recommendation.\n\nHealth Benefits\n\nMost melons are rich in potassium, a nutrient that may help control blood pressure, regulate heart beat, and possibly prevent strokes. The 2005 Dietary Guidelines state that a potassium-rich diet helps keep salt from raising blood pressure and may also reduce the risk of developing kidney stones and possibly age-related bone loss. The guidelines encourage adults to consume 4,700 milligrams per day (while keeping sodium to less than 2,300 milligrams per day, which is one teaspoon of salt).\n\nMelons are also abundant in vitamin C, one arm of the now-famous disease-fighting antioxidant trio. Another arm that's well represented is beta-carotene. Researchers believe that beta-carotene and vitamin C are capable of preventing heart disease, cancer, and other chronic conditions. No matter which way you cut them, when it comes to nutrition, melons are number one.\n\nWatermelon is a valuable source of lycopene, one of the carotenoids that have actually been studied in humans. Research indicates that lycopene is helpful in reducing the risk of prostate, breast, and endometrial cancers, as well as lung and colon cancer.\n\nSelection and Storage\nThe three most popular melons in the United States are cantaloupe, watermelon, and honeydew. In general, look for melons that are evenly shaped with no bruises, cracks, or soft spots. Select melons that are heavy for their size; they tend to be juicier.\n\nCantaloupes should have a prominent light brown netting that stands out from the underlying smooth skin. If the stem is still attached, the melon was picked too early. Ripe cantaloupes have a mildly sweet fragrance. If the cantaloupe smells sickeningly sweet, or if there is mold where the stem used to be, it is probably overripe and quite possibly rotten. Cantaloupes continue to ripen off the vine, so if you buy it ripe, eat it as soon as possible.\n\nChoosing a watermelon is a little chancier. Watermelons don't ripen much after they are picked, so what you see is what you get. The single most reliable sign of ripeness is a firm underside with a yellowish color; if it is white or green, the melon is not yet mature. A whole watermelon keeps in the refrigerator up to a week, but cut watermelon should be eaten as soon as possible. The flesh deteriorates rapidly, taking on an unappetizing slimy texture.\n\nRipe honeydew, signaled by a yellowish-white color, is the sweetest of the melons. Avoid those that are paper-white or greenish white; they'll never ripen. If the skin of a honeydew is smooth, it was picked prematurely. It should have a slightly sticky feel, indicating the natural sugars in the melon's flesh are seeping through the skin. It will be deliciously ripe! Honeydews keep longer than cantaloupes, but should still be refrigerated. Try to cut it open within four to five days. When you do, leave the seeds in place until you're ready to eat it; they help keep the fruit moist.\n\nPreparation and Serving Tips\nSome people like melons only slightly chilled or even room temperature, but watermelons taste best when they're served icy cold. A multicolored melon-ball salad topped with fresh, chopped mint makes a pretty dessert. Chilled melon soup is a refreshing change of pace in hot weather. And the natural cavity left in a cantaloupe after removing the seeds is a perfect place for fillers like nonfat yogurt or fruit salad. Squeeze a little lemon or lime juice onto cut melon for extra flavor.\n\nFor those watching their weight, a good rule of thumb is to keep your total added sugar intake below 32 grams per day for a 2,000 calorie diet. A sweet wedge of watermelon could be the missing piece of the dieting puzzle for you.\n\n©Publications International, Ltd.\n\nNutritional Values\nCantaloupe\n\nServing Size: 1 cup\n\nCalories: 53\n\nFat: 0 g\n\nSaturated Fat: na\n\nCholesterol: 0 mg\n\nCarbohydrate: 12 g\n\nProtein: 1 g\n\nDietary Fiber: 1 g\n\nSodium: 23 mg\n\nVitamin A: 5,276 IU\n\nFolic Acid: 33 mcg\n\nNiacin: 1 mg\n\nVitamin B6: <1 mg\n\nVitamin C: 57 mg\n\nCalcium: 14 mg\n\nMagnesium: 19 mg\n\nPotassium: 417 mg\n\nCarotenoids: 3,219 mcg\n\nWatermelon\n\nServing Size: 1 cup\n\nCalories: 46\n\nFat: 0 g\n\nSaturated Fat: na\n\nCholesterol: 0 mg\n\nCarbohydrate: 11 g\n\nProtein: 1 g\n\nDietary Fiber: 1 g\n\nSodium: 2 mg\n\nVitamin A: 865 IU\n\nNiacin: <1 mg\n\nPantothenic Acid: <1 mg Thiamin: <1 mg\n\nVitamin B6: <1 mg\n\nVitamin C: 12 mg\n\nCalcium: 11 mg\n\nMagnesium: 15 mg\n\nPotassium: 170 mg\n\nCopper: <2 mg\n\nCarotenoids: 7,481 mcg\n\nREAD MORE\nBran Cereals: Natural Weight-Loss Food\nBy: the Editors of Publications International, Ltd.\n\nYou might not look forward to it, but you still pour that bowl of bran cereal every day to keep yourself regular. Little did you know your bowlful was fighting fat, too.\n\nFirst, let's define what we mean by bran. Bran is simply the outer layer of any kernel of grain, where most of the fiber and nutrients reside. Here, we're just focusing on wheat bran cereals. (Learn more information about the weight-loss benefits of oats and oat bran by following the link.)\n\nNow, back to fighting fat. Fiber, especially the insoluble kind, fills you up. It has an amazing capacity to absorb water and expand. This bulk fools your belly into thinking you've eaten a lot, so it can shut down your hunger signals.\n\nMoreover, bran fiber requires a bit of chewing. That gives your body time to realize you're full before you shove in more. You complete the fat-fighting breakfast scene if you pour skim milk over that bowl of bran, mix in fresh fruit, and have a glass of orange juice on the side.\n\nHealth Benefits\n\nNo other food packs such a wallop of insoluble fiber at one sitting. There's no underestimating the health boost from a daily bowl of bran cereal. Here's a chronicle.\n\nConstipation: Eat enough insoluble fiber, such as bran, and you're practically guaranteed to avoid constipation -- as long as you increase your fluid intake, too. By absorbing water, bran creates bulk, which stimulates the intestines to contract and move things along.\n\nColon cancer: By increasing stool speed, bran ensures that bowel contents don't stagnate, so that means carcinogens, or cancer-causing agents, can't hang around long enough to cause trouble. And if carcinogens are present, a bulkier stool dilutes them. Other digestive-tract conditions: A soft, swift-moving stool may prevent and ease the pain associated with many other digestive conditions, such as hemorrhoids.\n\nAll this should be enough to convince you to dig into your bowl of bran with vigor. It gets your system going in the morning while providing as much as half the suggested fiber goal of 20 to 35 grams a day.\n\nSelection and Storage\nYou don't need to swallow bran cereal as if it's medicine. Try different brands to find one you like. Bran-bud cereals provide a lot of fiber per spoonful, but flakes may be more palatable. Check labels to compare fiber and calories. Some raisin brans supply almost twice the calories. Be sure to note serving sizes; they may be very different from your usual bowlful. Compare sugar, sodium, and fat, too. But don't get paranoid about these ingredients. You're better off getting the fiber. You can make up for extra sugar, sodium, and fat at other meals.\n\nStore opened cereals in a dry location. Once opened, they will keep for a few months before going stale. If you live in a humid environment, transfer cereals to plastic bags and refrigerate them.\n\nPreparation and Serving Tips\n\nAs American breakfasts go, a bowl of bran cereal with fat-free milk is much, much healthier than an old-fashioned farm breakfast. While having bran for breakfast may be the best way to wake up your digestive tract, it's just as healthy as an afternoon pick-me-up or a bedtime snack. Dare to be different; top yours with nonfat yogurt instead of milk. Or sprinkle bran cereal on yogurt, salads, or cut-up fruit. Use it to coat fish or to top a tuna casserole. These are painless ways to add filling fiber to your family's menu.\n\nSo let's recap. Eating a high-fiber meal is great for weight loss. High-fiber foods generally require more chewing time, so you're less likely to overeat. Also, a high-fiber diet tends to make a meal feel larger and linger longer, so you stay full for a greater amount of time. No other food packs as much fiber as a bowl of bran cereal. This food is an easy addition to a weight-loss diet.\n\n©Publications International, Ltd.\n\nNutritional Values Kellogg's All-Bran\nServing Size: 1/3 cup (1 oz)\n\nCalories: 75\n\nFat: <1 g\n\nSaturated Fat: na\n\nCholesterol: 0 mg\n\nCarbohydrate: 24 g\n\nProtein: 2 g\n\nDietary Fiber: 13 g\n\nSodium: 203 mg\n\nVitamin A: 510 IU\n\nVitamin C: 6 mg\n\nThiamin: <1 mg\n\nRiboflavin: <1 mg\n\nNiacin: 5 mg\n\nVitamin B6: 2 mg\n\nFolic Acid: 391 mcg\n\nCopper: <1 mg\n\nIron: 5 mg\n\nMagnesium: 62 mg\n\nPhosphorus: 150 mg\n\nPotassium: 300 mg\n\nZinc: 2 mg\n\nREAD MORE\nLegumes: Natural Food\nBy: Brian Boone\n\nlegumes\nLegumes are packed with fiber, which is good for your cholesterol levels.\nTHINKSTOCK\nLegumes are a vegetable family of bite-sized seeds. They're grown all over the world and are eaten by virtually all cultures. Legumes are one of the most all-around nutritious foods. The family includes black beans, black-eyed peas, pinto beans, white beans, garbanzo beans (chickpeas), edamame (green soybeans), fava beans, red lentils, green lentils, lima beans and kidney beans.\n\nThe Meatless Marvel\n\nLegumes are packed with soluble fiber, which is broken down and absorbed by the body slowly, making you feel full for longer. Legumes contain about 12 to 15 grams of dietary fiber per cup. That's about half of what an adult needs each day. Fiber stabilizes blood sugar and also helps reduce cholesterol. Soluble fiber \"flushes out\" the bad cholesterol, which is perhaps the greatest health benefit of legumes. It also absorbs liquid inside the colon, which softens the stool, reducing constipation. It's also been reported that high bean consumption may reduce the risk of colon cancer [source: Johns Hopkins].\n\nMeat, cheese, eggs and dairy products contain protein, which humans need to survive, but they also have fat and cholesterol. Legumes are essentially fat-free and cholesterol-free.\n\nThey're the most potent source of non-animal based protein. The average cup of cooked beans contains as much protein as it does fiber -- 16 grams of protein, about a third of an adult's daily needs.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's nutritional guidelines suggest that Americans eat a minimum of three cups of legumes each week. The average American currently eats about a third of that.\n\nPreparation and Consumption\n\nLegumes are sold two ways: dried (in boxes, bags or bulk) or canned. Canned legumes are ready-to-eat and simply need to be warmed up in a pot or a microwave. Dried ones need to be rehydrated to ensure even cooking. There are two ways to rehydrate your beans:\n\nSoak dried beans overnight in cold water in the refrigerator.\nOr, add beans to boiling water, cover and let sit for three hours.\n(Note that lentils and black-eyed peas don't require soaking.)\n\nOnce they're rehydrated, they're ready to be cooked. Rinse them, cover with water in a stockpot, bring the water to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 45 minutes. Check them to be sure they're cooking consistently and add water when necessary.\n\nBeans are an incredibly versatile food. Cook them with salt and pepper and serve them as a hearty side dish, or use them in chili, soups, salads and casseroles (like red beans and red rice). Black beans can be mixed with salsa and chicken in a tortilla for a low-fat dinner.\n\nThe Musical Fruit\nOne problem with legumes: They're notorious for causing gas. They do this because some of the carbohydrates in beans are oligosaccharides, molecules that the body doesn't have the enzymes to break down. Those molecules wind up in the large intestine, where native bacteria eat them, a process that lets out gas. If you'd prefer to avoid this unpleasant side effect, eat canned legumes instead of fresh beans. The legume canning process destroys some of the oligosaccharides. Or change the water every so often while you soak your fresh beans.\n\nBlack Beans Nutritional Values\nThe nutritional values of the various legumes vary.

It's this same vital component that makes them perfect for healthy eating and keeping your hunger to a minimum.\n\nA prune is a dried plum, typically the European variety of plum. The fruit's name was officially changed from \"prunes\" to \"dried plums\" by the Food and Drug Administration in 2001.\n\nThough relatively high in calories for their size, prunes have a reputation as a dieter's friend. They add a powerful dose of fiber and some nutrients to your diet that are needed when you follow a lower-calorie meal plan.\n\nHealth Benefits\n\nPrunes are a sweet way to add fat-free laxative fiber to your diet. A single prune contains more than half a gram of fiber and more than one gram of sorbitol (a carbohydrate that our bodies do not absorb well). Large amounts of sorbitol can cause diarrhea. Prunes also contain the laxative, diphenylisatin. No wonder they prevent constipation. So snack away, just don't go overboard. Although according to the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, it takes only 1/2 cup of dried fruit to count as 1 cup of fruit, you may want to eat less than that at any one time.\n\nIn contrast, prunes' reputation for being rich in iron doesn't hold true. In reality, they're a decent, but not spectacular, source. Prunes, however, get overlooked as a source of vitamin A, even though they provide more than ten percent of recommended levels. Potassium is another unexpected benefit you get from eating prunes, which is beneficial for blood pressure and regulating your heartbeat.\n\nPrunes contain the same phenols that plums have, protecting the fats in our system from damage. They also have significant amounts of beta-carotene, whose antioxidant function helps prevent cataracts, cancer, and heart disease.\n\nSelection and Storage\nWhen selecting prunes, look for well-sealed packages, such as those that are vacuum-sealed. After opening, seal the package or transfer the prunes to an airtight container or plastic bag. Stored in a cool, dry location or in the refrigerator, they'll keep for several months.\n\nPreparation and Serving Tips\nYou can eat them out of the box, of course. They make a great portable fat-free snack. Combine them with dried apricots for a delightful mix of sweet and tangy flavors. Or mix them with nuts and seeds for a healthy trail mix. But watch out: The calories add up fast, about 20 per prune.\n\nIf you're not crazy about eating whole prunes, try prune bits in your baking. They'll add sweetness, flavor, and fiber to quick breads, snack bars, even pancakes. Better yet, for real fat-fighting success, puree eight ounces of pitted prunes and six tablespoons of hot water in a food processor for a great fat substitute to use in baked goods. Replace butter, margarine, shortening, or oil in your baked good recipes with half the amount of the prune puree.\n\nFor example, if the recipe calls for one cup of butter, substitute a half cup of prune puree. Tightly covered, the prune puree will keep about one week in the refrigerator. Its flavor combines especially well with chocolate-based desserts.\n\nSo don't just think of prunes as an antidote for constipation. They help weight loss by keeping hunger at bay and potential inches off your waist.\n\n©Publications International, Ltd.\n\nNutritional Values Prunes, Dried\nServing Size: 4 medium\n\nCalories: 80\n\nFat: 0 g\n\nSaturated Fat: 0 g\n\nCholesterol: 0 mg\n\nCarbohydrate: 21 g\n\nProtein: 1 g\n\nDietary Fiber: 2 g\n\nSodium: 1 mg\n\nVitamin A: 262 IU\n\nIron: 1 mg\n\nPotassium: 246 mg\n\nCarotenoids: 232 mcg\n\nREAD MORE\nDry Beans and Peas: Natural Weight-Loss Food\nBy: the Editors of Publications International, Ltd.\n\nIf you had to pick one food to be stuck on a desert island with, it would have to be beans. They'd provide you with almost complete nutrition and you wouldn't have to worry about offending anyone.\n\nYes, beans can be gassy, but there are ways around that. So don't let their \"explosive\" nature scare you away from some of the best lean protein around.\n\nWhen your diet's based on protein -- and fiber-rich beans and other complex carbohydrates -- you're more likely to feel full sooner. In addition, a diet high in fiber can reduce your risk of developing diabetes and help lower blood cholesterol levels, which can reduce your risk of heart disease.\n\nComplementing beans with grain foods, like rice, makes them a great substitute for higher-fat protein sources like meats. Beans are also filling enough to stave off hunger. The low-fat, high-fiber nature of a bean-centered diet means chances are good that you'll lose weight eating this way. The 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend eating 3 cups of beans per week.\n\nHealth Benefits\n\nNot only are beans low in fat and high in quality protein, but they also have the added bonus of soluble fiber's disease-preventing qualities. The soluble fiber in beans dissolves in water, trapping bile acids in its gummy goo. This lowers blood levels of damaging LDL cholesterol, especially if LDL cholesterol levels were high to begin with, without compromising the level of protective HDL cholesterol.\n\nBecause beans are singled out for their soluble fiber, you may not realize they also provide substantial insoluble fiber, which helps combat constipation, colon cancer, and other conditions that afflict your digestive tract. How? Insoluble fiber absorbs water, which swells the size of stool, puts pressure on the intestines, and moves everything along faster. To help combat the gas problem -- caused by indigestible carbohydrates -- let your body get used to eating beans. Start slowly, eating only small amounts at first, and try to eat them when you know you'll be active afterward; it helps break up the gas.\n\nBeans contain several types of phytochemicals. They are rich in lignans, which may play a role in preventing osteoporosis, heart disease, and certain cancers. The flavonoids in beans may help reduce heart disease and cancer risk. Phytosterols, also in legumes, help reduce blood cholesterol levels.\n\nAs for vitamins and minerals, beans are a bonanza of folic acid, copper, iron, and magnesium -- four nutrients that many nutrition experts agree we don't get enough of. Indeed, most dry beans and peas are rich sources of iron -- ideal for people who don't eat meat. The nutritional content of most beans is very similar to the black beans we've chosen as a representative example. (Soybeans are in a class by themselves, so are listed separately.) Exceptions? White beans have almost twice the iron of black beans, while kidney beans are somewhere in between. And fiber does vary. Most differences, however, are minor.\n\nSelection and Storage\n\nDry beans are available year-round, are inexpensive, and can be found in any well-stocked supermarket near the rice, or check the ethnic food section. You may need to visit a health-food store for more exotic varieties. Packaged or loose, select beans that look clean, are not shriveled, and are uniformly sized with even color and uncracked hulls. Discard any pebbles, as well as any beans with pinholes, a sign of insect infestation. Some varieties of beans are available canned. They offer convenience but are rather mushy and very salty, although researchers have found that rinsing canned beans under cold running water for one minute eliminates up to 60 percent of the added salt. If stored properly, dried beans last for a year or more. If packaged, keep them in their unopened bag. Once open, or if you bought them in bulk, store them in a dry, airtight glass jar in a cool, dark spot. Store cooked beans in an airtight container for up to one week in the refrigerator or freeze for up to six months.\n\nPreparation and Serving Tips\n\nWhen cooking dry beans, it's best to plan ahead; they do not qualify as \"fast\" food. Before soaking or cooking, sort through the beans, discarding shriveled or discolored beans, pebbles, and debris; then rinse the beans under cold running water. It's best to soak beans overnight for six to eight hours. This softens the beans, reduces the cooking time, and removes the gas-promoting undigestible carbohydrates.\n\nBut if you haven't planned far enough ahead, you can quick-soak them (although you'll end up with less-firm beans): Put the beans in water and boil for one minute, turn off the heat, and let them stand in the same water for one hour.\n\nAfter soaking, discard any beans that float to the top, throw out the soaking water (which contains the gas-producing indigestible carbohydrates), and add fresh water to the pot before cooking. Add enough water to cover the beans by two inches. Bring to a boil, then simmer, covered, until tender -- about one to three hours, depending on the bean variety. They're done when you can easily stick them with a fork.\n\nBeans are notoriously bland-tasting, but that makes them versatile. They take on the spices of any ethnic cuisine. Many cultures have perfected the art of combining beans with grains or seeds to provide a complete protein. For instance, try Mexican corn tortillas with beans and tomatoes, or classic Spanish rice and beans, or traditional Italian pasta e fagioli (a pasta and bean soup). You can't beat black bean soup with complementary corn bread on the side.\n\nRediscover beans and peas and all the nutrition and versatility they have to offer. Find a way to work these valuable vegetables into your diet. Experiment with the types of beans and peas you like best in your recipes to make your weight-loss meals and snacks both nutritious and interesting.",
